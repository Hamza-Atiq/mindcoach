Quick Breathing — 1 minute.

Hi, Nova here. A one-minute reset.
Sit or stand straight. Close your eyes if it’s safe. Breathe in for 4 seconds — 1, 2, 3, 4. Pause 1 second. Exhale 5 seconds — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Repeat this 5 times.

Keep attention on the breath. If your mind wanders, gently return to the breath. Finish with one normal breath and notice how the body feels.
