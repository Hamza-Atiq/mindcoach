Pre-Game Focus — 2 minutes.

Hi, I’m Nova. Let’s quickly center your attention for the game.
Find a comfortable stance, feet shoulder-width apart. Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds — 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold for 2 seconds — 1, 2. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. (Repeat this cycle four times.)

Now, bring to mind one clear performance intention — a single thing you will focus on in this match. It could be "clean footwork" or "controlled breathing" — keep it simple.
On the next inhale, mentally say your intention once. When you exhale, release tension from your shoulders.

We will finish with three slow breaths. Inhale 4 — hold 2 — exhale 6. When you’re ready, open your eyes and bring the calm focus with you. Good luck — you’re ready.
