Calm Reset — 3 minutes.

Hello. This is a calm reset to recover focus.
Start with a gentle shoulder roll to release tension. Now place one hand on your chest and one hand on your belly. Breathe slowly: inhale for 4, exhale for 6. (Repeat three times.)

Scan your body from head to toes. With each breath out, soften an area that feels tight — shoulders, jaw, hands. Name it quietly ("shoulders"), and let it relax.

Now visualize a steady point — a spot on the horizon, a calm color, or a feeling of ease. Breathe toward that image. On your next exhale, say to yourself: "I am centered." Repeat twice.

When you finish, open your eyes slowly and bring the gentle calm into the next activity.
