Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds — 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold for 2 seconds — 1, 2. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. (Repeat this cycle four times.)\n\nNow, bring to mind one clear performance intention — a single thing you will focus on in this match. It could be \"clean footwork\" or \"controlled breathing\" — keep it simple.\nOn the next inhale, mentally say your intention once. When you exhale, release tension from your shoulders.\n\nWe will finish with three slow breaths. Inhale 4 — hold 2 — exhale 6. When you’re ready, open your eyes and bring the calm focus with you. Good luck — you’re ready."

Exhale 5 seconds — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Repeat this 5 times.\n\nKeep attention on the breath. If your mind wanders, gently return to the breath. Finish with one normal breath and notice how the body feels."

Now place one hand on your chest and one hand on your belly. Breathe slowly: inhale for 4, exhale for 6. (Repeat three times.)\n\nScan your body from head to toes. With each breath out, soften an area that feels tight — shoulders, jaw, hands. Name it quietly (\"shoulders\"), and let it relax.\n\nNow visualize a steady point — a spot on the horizon, a calm color, or a feeling of ease. Breathe toward that image. On your next exhale, say to yourself: \"I am centered.\" Repeat twice.\n\nWhen you finish, open your eyes slowly and bring the gentle calm into the next activity."
